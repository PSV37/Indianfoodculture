						<h5>About Indian food </h5>
					
                        	<span>Indian food is diverse as well as vast. There is so much variety that we bet one cannot find such a massive variety in any country. From simple everyday recipes to complex recipes, from a basic dal to a rich biryani, from a light meal to a full thali meal. There are thousands of varieties of food that one gets in India. Not to forget the sweets and desserts too. yet another Indian culinary delight is the Indian street food. the recipes are also markedly different pertaining to the different regions.</span>
					<span> The north indian food is different than the south indian food. then there is the rajasthani, Gujarati, maharashtrian, goan food – which forms the western belt and the central belt – the bihari, Agarwal, Awadhi and lucknowi cuisine which is again very different. in between there are parsi, east indian, sindhi and iranian flavors too. not to forget the north eastern states as well as kashmiri cuisine. so welcome to the land of indian food. </span>
                   <span>We thought we’d celebrate with a fresh, new Food. Our aim is to make all this cooking, eating and sharing easier. Whether it’s finding a recipe, showing off your latest cooking triumph, photographing a killer meal or sharing the shortcuts that make your life run more smoothly, the new-and-improved Food.com makes this place – your home for sharing all things food – the spot to be.</span>
